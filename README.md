#UAuliver

UAuliver (prononunced 'oooh-Oliver') is a simple firefox extension that
resets your user agent every few seconds to a randomly generated series
of emojis.

## Why? ##

...

## Should I use this if I want privacy? ##

No - you'll stand out like a shiny faceplate in everyone's logs, since there are
not many other users of this extension out there. Use it only when you want
to stand out in logs / possibly confuse data analysts!
